# hangmanGame
This game searches through a long text file of random movie titles and selects a secret word. A user selects letters to guess compose the word, until the word has been discovered or until the remaining strikes descends to zero.

The user will be shown the letters that have already been selected in alphabetical order, and the user will be instructed to chose again if they accidentally select the same letter twice (this will not count as a strike). The user may also guess the entire word at any point during the game.
